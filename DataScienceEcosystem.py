# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem Overview
# 
# In this notebook, a comprehensive summary of Data Science Tools and the surrounding ecosystem is provided, offering insights into the key languages, frameworks, and methodologies that empower data scientists in their analytical endeavors.

# # **Objectives:**
# 
# - Understand popular languages used in Data Science.
# - Explore commonly used libraries for Data Science tasks.
# - Gain insights into key development environment tools for Data Scientists.
# - Learn to evaluate arithmetic expressions in Python.
# - Convert units (e.g., minutes to hours) using Python expressions.

# # Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. **Python:** Widely used for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
# 
# 2. **R:** Preferred for statistical computing and graphics, with a rich ecosystem for data analysis.
# 
# 3. **SQL:** Essential for working with relational databases and querying structured data.

# # Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. **NumPy:** A fundamental package for scientific computing with support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.
# 
# 2. **Pandas:** An essential data manipulation library that provides data structures like DataFrame, enabling efficient data analysis and manipulation.
# 
# 3. **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library that offers simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling, including various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
# 
# 4. **Matplotlib:** A versatile plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
# 
# 5. **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
# 
# These libraries form the backbone of many data science projects, providing robust tools for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

# ### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python
# 
# Below are four examples illustrating the evaluation of arithmetic expressions in Python:

# # This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
# result = (3 * 4) + 5
# 
# # Display the result
# print(result)

# In[1]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5

# Display the result
print(result)


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
hours = 200 / 60

# Display the result
print(hours)
